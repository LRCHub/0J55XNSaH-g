When the heat's on high but you feel so cold
Don't want to talk anymore you want to hide the phone
Ah-haa-ha-uw!
Ah!
You can't dance but you can't keep still
You don't want to be the brake but that's how it feels
I'll be a painkiller for you
I'll be a painkiller for you
Just for you
When you're down on the floor with your head in your hands
And you can't believe that anything can be so bad
Whooo-ooh!
I'll be a painkiller for you
I'll be a painkiller for you
Just for you
Uh!
Just for you
But the world don't owe anyone anything
It's time to listen
Yeah it's time to listen
I'll be a painkiller for you
I'll be a painkiller for you
Just for you
Just for you
Just for you!
Just for you!!
Ah! Ah!
Just for you!
Aouw-a-haa!
Just for you
