Kill the pain
Kill the pain

The world
You know you got me hurtin'
I wants to kill, I wants to kill the pain

The world
You know you got me hurtin'
I wants to kill, I wants to kill the pain

The world
You know you got me hurtin'
I wants to kill, I wants to kill the pain

The world
You know you got me hurtin'
I wants to kill, I wants to kill the pain

Uh, my stereo man is my number one high

(The world)
(I want to kill, kill)
(I wants to kill, I wants to kill the pain)

The world
Kill the pain, kill the pain
